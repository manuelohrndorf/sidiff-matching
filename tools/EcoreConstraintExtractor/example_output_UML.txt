:::eClassifiers:::Abstraction:
		
Inherits from: #//Dependency
An abstraction is a relationship that relates two elements or sets of elements that represent the same concept at different levels of abstraction or from different viewpoints.

-eStructuralFeatures:mapping:
			
An composition of an Expression that states the abstraction relationship between the supplier and the client. In some cases, such as Derivation, it is usually formal and unidirectional; in other cases, such as Trace, it is usually informal and bidirectional. The mapping expression is optional and may be omitted if the precise relationship between the elements is not specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::Dependency:
		
Inherits from: #//PackageableElement #//DirectedRelationship
A dependency is a relationship that signifies that a single or a set of model elements requires other model elements for their specification or implementation. This means that the complete semantics of the depending elements is either semantically or structurally dependent on the definition of the supplier element(s).

-eStructuralFeatures:client:
			
The element(s) dependent on the supplier element(s). In some cases (such as a Trace Abstraction) the assignment of direction (that is, the designation of the client element) is at the discretion of the modeler, and is a stipulation.


-eStructuralFeatures:supplier:
			
The element(s) independent of the client element(s), in the same respect and the same dependency relationship. In some directed dependency relationships (such as Refinement Abstractions), a common convention in the domain of class-based OO software is to put the more abstract element in this role. Despite this convention, users of UML may stipulate a sense of dependency suitable for their domain, which makes a more abstract element dependent on that which is more specific.

----------------------------------------------------------------

:::eClassifiers:::Classifier:
		
Inherits from: #//Namespace #//RedefinableElement #//Type #//TemplateableElement
A classifier is a classification of instances - it describes a set of instances that have features in common. A classifier can specify a generalization hierarchy by referencing its general classifiers.
A classifier has the capability to own use cases. Although the owning classifier typically represents the subject to which the owned use cases apply, this is not necessarily the case. In principle, the same use case can be applied to multiple subjects, as identified by the subject association role of a use case.
Classifier is defined to be a kind of templateable element so that a classifier can be parameterized. It is also defined to be a kind of parameterable element so that a classifier can be a formal template parameter.
A classifier has the capability to own collaboration uses. These collaboration uses link a collaboration with the classifier to give a description of the workings of the classifier.

-contents:isTemplate:
			
The query isTemplate() returns whether this templateable element is actually a template.

result = (n.visibility <> VisibilityKind::private)


-eOperations:inherit:

-eStructuralFeatures:isFinalSpecialization:
			
If true, the Classifier cannot be specialized by generalization. Note that this property is preserved through package merge operations; that is, the capability to specialize a Classifier (i.e., isFinalSpecialization =false) must be preserved in the resulting Classifier of a package merge operation where a Classifier with isFinalSpecialization =false is merged with a matching Classifier with isFinalSpecialization =true: the resulting Classifier will have isFinalSpecialization =false.

:::eClassifiers:::Property:
		
Inherits from: #//StructuralFeature #//ConnectableElement #//DeploymentTarget
Property represents a declared state of one or more instances in terms of a named relationship to a value or values. When a property is an attribute of a classifier, the value or values are related to the instance of the classifier by being held in slots of the instance. When a property is an association end, the value or values are related to the instance or instances at the other end(s) of the association. The range of valid values represented by the property can be controlled by setting the property's type.
A property is a structural feature of a classifier that characterizes instances of the classifier. A property related by ownedAttribute to a classifier (other than an association) represents an attribute and might also represent an association end. It relates an instance of the class to a value or set of values of the type of the attribute. A property related by memberEnd or its specializations to an association represents an end of the association. The type of the property is the type of the end of the association.
A property has the capability of being a deployment target in a deployment relationship. This enables modeling the deployment to hierarchical nodes that have properties functioning as internal parts.
Property specializes ParameterableElement to specify that a property can be exposed as a formal template parameter, and provided as an actual parameter in a binding of a template.

Otherwise, to determine the context of a Behavior, find the first BehavioredClassifier reached by following the chain of owner relationships from the Behavior, if any. If there is such a BehavioredClassifier, then it is the context, unless it is itself a Behavior with a non-empty context, in which case that is also the context for the original Behavior.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::Interface:
		
Inherits from: #//Classifier
Since an interface specifies conformance characteristics, it does not own detailed behavior specifications. Instead, interfaces may own a protocol state machine that specifies event sequences and pre/post conditions for the operations and receptions described by the interface.
Interfaces may include receptions (in addition to operations).
An interface is a kind of classifier that represents a declaration of a set of coherent public features and obligations. An interface specifies a contract; any instance of a classifier that realizes the interface must fulfill that contract. The obligations that may be associated with an interface are in the form of various kinds of constraints (such as pre- and post-conditions) or protocol specifications, which may impose ordering restrictions on interactions through the interface.

Inherits from: #//DirectedRelationship
A generalization is a taxonomic relationship between a more general classifier and a more specific classifier. Each instance of the specific classifier is also an indirect instance of the general classifier. Thus, the specific classifier inherits the features of the more general classifier.
A generalization relates a specific classifier to a more general classifier, and is owned by the specific classifier.

Indicates whether or not the set of specific Classifiers in a Generalization relationship have instance in common. If isDisjoint is true, the specific Classifiers for a particular GeneralizationSet have no members in common; that is, their intersection is empty. If isDisjoint is false, the specific Classifiers in a particular GeneralizationSet have one or more members in common; that is, their intersection is not empty. For example, Person could have two Generalization relationships, each with the different specific Classifier: Manager or Staff. This would be disjoint because every instance of Person must either be a Manager or Staff. In contrast, Person could have two Generalization relationships involving two specific (and non-covering) Classifiers: Sales Person and Manager. This GeneralizationSet would not be disjoint because there are instances of Person which can be a Sales Person and a Manager.

:::eClassifiers:::Connector:
		
Inherits from: #//Feature
A delegation connector is a connector that links the external contract of a component (as specified by its ports) to the realization of that behavior. It represents the forwarding of events (operation requests and events): a signal that arrives at a port that has a delegation connector to one or more parts or ports on parts will be passed on to those targets for handling. An assembly connector is a connector between two or more parts or ports on parts that defines that one or more parts provide the services that other parts use.
Specifies a link that enables communication between two or more instances. This link may be an instance of an association, or it may represent the possibility of the instances being able to communicate because their identities are known by virtue of being passed in as parameters, held in variables or slots, or because the communicating instances are the same instance. The link may be realized by something as simple as a pointer or by something as complex as a network connection.

This indicates the format of the content - which is how the string content should be interpreted. The following values are reserved: SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG, WMF, EMF, BMP. In addition the prefix 'MIME: ' is also reserved. This option can be used as an alternative to express the reserved values above, for example "SVG" could instead be expressed as "MIME: image/svg+xml".

:::eClassifiers:::StructuredActivityNode:
		
Inherits from: #//Action #//Namespace #//ActivityGroup
A structured activity node is an executable activity node that may have an expansion into subordinate nodes as an activity group. The subordinate nodes must belong to only one structured activity node, although they may be nested.
Because of the concurrent nature of the execution of actions within and across activities, it can be difficult to guarantee the consistent access and modification of object memory. In order to avoid race conditions or other concurrency-related problems, it is sometimes necessary to isolate the effects of a group of actions from the effects of actions outside the group. This may be indicated by setting the mustIsolate attribute to true on a structured activity node. If a structured activity node is "isolated," then any object used by an action within the node cannot be accessed by any action outside the node until the structured activity node as a whole completes. Any concurrent actions that would result in accessing such objects are required to have their execution deferred until the completion of the node.

It may be used to specify a variety of different kinds of constraints, such as values of attributes or variables, internal or external states, and so on. A state invariant is an interaction fragment and it is placed on a lifeline.

-contents:covered:
			
References the Lifeline on which the StateInvariant appears.

:::eClassifiers:::TestIdentityAction:
		
Inherits from: #//Action
A test identity action is an action that tests if two values are identical objects.

-eOperations:multiplicity:
			
The multiplicity of the input pins is 1..1.
self.first.multiplicity.is(1,1)
and self.second.multiplicity.is(1,1)



-eOperations:no_type:
			
The input pins have no type.
self.first.type->size() = 0
and self.second.type->size() = 0



-eOperations:result_is_boolean:
			
The type of the result is the UML standard primitive type Boolean. (This is not directly representable in OCL at the metamodel level.)
true



-eStructuralFeatures:first:
			
Gives the pin on which an object is placed.


-eStructuralFeatures:result:
			
Tells whether the two input objects are identical.


-eStructuralFeatures:second:
			
Gives the pin on which an object is placed.

:::eClassifiers:::TimeConstraint:
		
Inherits from: #//IntervalConstraint
A time constraint is a constraint that refers to a time interval.

-contents:specification:
			
A condition that must be true when evaluated in order for the constraint to be satisfied.


-eStructuralFeatures:firstEvent:
			
The value of firstEvent is related to constrainedElement. If firstEvent is true, then the corresponding observation event is the first time instant the execution enters constrainedElement. If firstEvent is false, then the corresponding observation event is the last time instant the execution is within constrainedElement.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::TimeInterval:
		
Inherits from: #//Interval
A time interval defines the range between two time expressions.

-contents:max:
			
Refers to the TimeExpression denoting the maximum value of the range.


-contents:min:
			
Refers to the TimeExpression denoting the minimum value of the range.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::TimeExpression:
		
Inherits from: #//ValueSpecification
A time expression defines a value specification that represents a time value.

-contents:stringValue:
			
true


-eStructuralFeatures:expr:
			
The value of the time expression.


-eStructuralFeatures:observation:
			
Refers to the time and duration observations that are involved in expr.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::TimeEvent:
		
Inherits from: #//Event
A time event can be defined relative to entering the current state of the executing state machine.
A time event specifies a point in time. At the specified time, the event occurs.

-eOperations:starting_time:
			
The starting time for a relative time event may only be omitted for a time event that is the trigger of a state machine.
true


-eOperations:when_non_negative:
			
The ValueSpecification when must return a non-negative Integer.
true


-eStructuralFeatures:isRelative:
			
Specifies whether it is relative or absolute time.


-eStructuralFeatures:when:
			
Specifies the corresponding time deadline.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::TimeObservation:
		
Inherits from: #//Observation
A time observation is a reference to a time instant during an execution. It points out the element in the model to observe and whether the observation is when this model element is entered or when it is exited.

-eStructuralFeatures:event:
			
The observation is determined by the entering or exiting of the event element during execution.


-eStructuralFeatures:firstEvent:
			
The value of firstEvent is related to event. If firstEvent is true, then the corresponding observation event is the first time instant the execution enters event. If firstEvent is false, then the corresponding observation event is the time instant the execution exits event.

----------------------------------------------------------------
:::eClassifiers:::UnmarshallAction:
		
Inherits from: #//Action
An unmarshall action is an action that breaks an object of a known type into outputs each of which is equal to a value from a structural feature of the object.

The type of the object input pin must be the same as the unmarshall classifier.
true


-eOperations:structural_feature:
			
The unmarshall classifier must have at least one structural feature.
