aboutText=SiLift provides a rule-based implementation of lifting differences onto a more meaningful level:\n\
Low-level differences are represented based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework.\n\
They are transformed into representations of editing operations using the rule-based\n\
model transformation engine EMF Henshin. The necessary transformation rules are\n\
automatically derived from basic transformation rules for the editing operations.\n\
SiLift offers the functionalities of consistency-perserving comparing, patching and merging models.\n\
